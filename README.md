# Example scripts attached to the ICRC contribution

## Example scripts

The examples come from the ICRC proceeding "Gammapy: high level data analysis for extragalactic science cases with the Cherenkov Telescope Array" that can be found [here](XXX). They can be found in the corresponding repositories: 
 - [Extrapolation of blazars from Fermi/LAT catalogues](./blazar/)
 - [The EBL scale factor](./ebl_scale/)
 - [Observational window for gamma-ray bursts](./ebl_scale/)

Those examples have been developped with the [Gammapy](http://docs.gammapy.org/en/latest/) version 0.6.dev4766 and the [Sherpa](https://github.com/sherpa/sherpa) version 4.9.0.
